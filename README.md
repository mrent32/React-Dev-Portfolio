# React-Dev-Portfolio
Welcome to my personal software developer portfolio using React! This application demonstrates my abilities to create a 
single page application using the React skills I have acquired throughout my coding journey. The porfolio is using
React-Bootstrap as a css framework, and emailjs as a contacting library. In addition I have used nodejs as the runtime environment
and vite to create the project. Below is a gif of the deployed application.
